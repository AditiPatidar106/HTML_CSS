				<h2>The Invisible Man</h2>
				<div class="book" id="book5"> </div>
				<div class="about-book">
					<p>The Invisible Man is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. Originally serialized in Pearson's
						Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man to whom the title
						refers is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and who invents a
						way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects
						light. He carries out this procedure on himself and renders himself invisible, but fails in his attempt to
						reverse it. A practitioner of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic
						character in horror fiction. </p>
